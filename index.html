	While completing my BSc in Physics, I discovered a real passion for Maths and Science.  After completing my degree, I left the police force to become a secondary school teacher and discovered my ability to teach students of all secondary ages across the ability range. <br>I trained in teaching both Maths and Science and have been very successful in teaching many students over my 5 year teaching career so far. <br>I am now expanding my teaching to tutoring outside of a school setting.  I am experienced in not just getting students their best possible mark in their exams but also inspiring and developing a love of Maths and Science.
