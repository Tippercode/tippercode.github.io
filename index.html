		Hi I am a qualified secondary teacher of maths and science up to KS5. Currently working at a secondary school teaching science KS4 and physics at KS5.<br>
	    While completing my degree in physics I discovered a real passion for maths and science.After completing my degree I left the police force to become a secondary school teacher and discovered an ability to teach to all levels of student. I trained in teaching both maths and science and have been very successful in teaching many students over my 5 years as a school teacher. I am now expanding my teaching to tutoring outside of a school setting. I am experienced in not just getting students their best possible mark in their exams but also inspiring and developing a love for the subjects of maths and science.<br>
